Billingual pun on German "Serienmörder" (serial killer) and "Reihenmusik" (row music, an old name for twelve-tone method, commonly called 'serialism' in English), the former referring to the inhuman abominations spawned in MIDI output with every iteration and the latter referring to the specific musical framework used.
